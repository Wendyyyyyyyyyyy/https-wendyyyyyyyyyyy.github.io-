        - Field: Computer Vision in Medical
        - Supervisor: Prof. Kenneth Wong
        - Summary: Developed machine learning models for analyzing echocardiography videos, focused on prediction of ejection fraction. Pioneered the use of machine learning models for predicting left atrial volume. Achieved breakthroughs in accuracy, boosting model performance by 17.4% with an R-square around 0.8. Addressed the model's initial bias by augmenting the dataset through both manually collected rare data cases and training the model for labeling video data.
