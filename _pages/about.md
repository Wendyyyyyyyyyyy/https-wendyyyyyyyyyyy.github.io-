I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong. I am now working with [Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/) in [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/)  focusing on human-centered machine learning. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in [HKU Computer Vision Laboratory]() guided by [Kenneth K.Y. Wong](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~kykwong/index.html).

My main research interest is in application of machine learning in real world. More specifically, the goal of my research is to develop innovative machine learning solutions that can address practical problems, enhance user experiences, and contribute to societal well-being. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work, have any questions or ideas to discuss with! :sparkles: :smile:
